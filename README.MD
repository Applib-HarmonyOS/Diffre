# Diffre
*pronounced - Differ*

Diffre is a sample Android application that shows how to change text color based on background.

This sample application exposes two possible implementations:

* A `Path`-based implementation that requires API level 19
* A `Region`-based implementation that requires API level 1

*Heavily influenced from [Romain Guy's Medium article](https://medium.com/@romainguy/a-better-underline-for-android-90ba3a2e4fb#.v4xblse45)*

This project was built because of this [Stack OverFlow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42246509/fill-shape-with-text-with-two-different-color)

Check out this other library I wrote: [LastPagerAdapter](https://github.com/rakshakhegde/LastPagerAdapter)

## Limitations
* Even though Region API works from API 1+, many devices I've encountered don't render it unless `layerType="software"` is specified. So this effectively makes Region API useful only from API 11.
